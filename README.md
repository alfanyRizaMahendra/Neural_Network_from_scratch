# Neural_Network_from_scratch
This project build single input single output neural network from scratch using C++ with editable configuration :
1. input function
2. autogenerate random dataset based on particular dataset width
3. the amount of hidden layer
4. the amount of neuron inside the hidden layer (each hidden layer have the same number of neuron)
5. the number of learning rate
6. the number of training steps

This project can also view the autogenerate random dataset, epoch / NN training progress, validation test to check the NN performance, training model result, and save the error logger data as .txt file
